# Wordpress Plugin
I decided to use MAMP to locally host the Wordpress site.

### Possibly Useful Information
In order to add posts I needed to install the Classic Editor Plugin but my plugin should work fine without it installed.
I had to change DB_HOST in the wp-config file to 127.0.0.1:8889 but I think that changing it back to localhost should be fine if there are any issues.
The OPI HTML plugin's settings page can be found as a submenu of the Settings menu
There is an admin account with the username: Admin1 and the Password: PluginDeveloper01 that can be used for testing

### Issues
There are a couple of features that I could not complete:
  Creating multiple HTML code sets
  Putting code sets in specific locations
