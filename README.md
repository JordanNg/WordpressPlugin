# Wordpress Plugin

I decided to use MAMP to locally host a Wordpress site so that I could start development of the plugin. 
I had to change DB_HOST in the wp-config file to 127.0.0.1:8889 but I think that changing it back to localhost should be fine if there are any issues.

In order to add posts I needed to install the Classic Editor Plugin but my plugin should work fine without it installed.
The OPI HTML plugin's settings page can be found as a submenu of the Settings menu
There is an admin account with the username: Admin1 and the Password: PluginDeveloper01 that can be used for testing

There are a couple of features that I could not complete:
  Creating multiple HTML code sets
  Putting code sets in specific locations
